# RxSwift

This is an attempt to build something like
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) in Swift,
while also incorporating ideas from my talk, [The Future of
ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/the-future-of-reactivecocoa).
Itâ€™s just a proof-of-concept, and is not intended for production use.

This project is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
